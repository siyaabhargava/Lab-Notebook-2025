#u can change the headers to match the file that you are reading in
#Short version: your column mappings don’t match your file’s headers, so the parser isn’t getting clean allele strings.
Option	When to use	In your case
--insert_value sample_size	if GWAS file has no sample size column	❌ remove
--insert_value n_cases	if GWAS file has no case count column	❌ remove
-output_column_map Neff sample_size	when file includes per-SNP Neff	✅ use
-output_column_map Ncases n_cases	when file includes Ncases	✅ use

#The PrediXcan/S-PrediXcan pipeline (through gwas_parsing.py and the imputation steps) only needs the following GWAS columns for each variant:
Required	Purpose
chromosome, position, effect_allele, non_effect_allele	variant identity
beta (or effect_size)	regression effect
se (standard error)	precision of effect
pvalue	significance
sample_size	total sample size or effective sample size
n_cases	only required for binary traits (like T2D)
